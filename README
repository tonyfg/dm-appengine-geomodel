Implementation of the geomodel library for dm-appengine.

This is still a pretty early sketch, not even suited for testing... If you really want to try it:

require 'geomodel'

class Thing
  include DataMapper::Resource #Or include DataMapper::AppEngineResource
  is :geomodel

  property :stuff, String
  property :location, GeoPt #You have to define a location property for
                            #GeoModel to work. This way you have a choice
end                         #to define it as required or optional.



# Lets create a new entity with a defined location
example = Thing.new
example.location = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(12.3, 45.9)
example.save

#Lets define 2 points for a bounding box
southwest = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(10, 45)
northeast = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(11, 46)

#Now we can do bounding box queries like this:

Thing.all(:location.gt => southwest, :location.lt => northeast)

#or like this:

Thing.all(:location.gt => "10.23,45.01", :location.lt => "11.03,46.34")

#in this case, we give the points as a string of format "lat,lng".




#TODO:
#Cut a gem.
#Document code and write a decent README / tutorial.
