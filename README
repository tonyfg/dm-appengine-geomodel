Implementation of the geomodel library for dm-appengine.

This is still a pretty early sketch, not even suited for testing... If you really want to try it:

require 'geomodel'

class Thing
  include GeoModel #Includes the geomodel stuff onto your model
  property :stuff, String
  property :location, GeoPt #You have to define this for GeoModel to work.
end

# Lets create a new entity with a defined location
example = Thing.new
example.location = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(12.3, 45.9)
example.save

#Lets define 2 points for a bounding box
southwest = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(10, 45)
northeast = AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt.new(11, 46)

#Now we can do bounding box queries like this:
Thing.within(southwest, northeast)


#TODO:
#When I have the time, this will be setup as datamapper is-geomodel plugin.
#It will be possible to query in a more natural way, like this:
#
#Thing.all(:location.gt => southwest, :location.lt => northeast)
#
#where southwest and northeast are AppEngine::Datastore::GeoPt instances, or
#
#Thing.all(:location.gt => "10.23,45.01", :location.lt => "11.03,46.34")
#
#where "10.23,45.01" is a string in the format "lat,lng".
#(useful for when you receive the bounding box as an URL parameter ;))
